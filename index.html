  <h4>ACADEMIC PROJECTS</h4>
  <h4><strong>Confernce Management System - Fall 2019</strong></h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Designed the database for storing the information of medical conferences.
    <li>Represented an ER diagram and relational schema of the medical conferences. Created SQL DDLs for the schemas using sqlite3.</li>
    <li>Implemented the BCNF on the original schema and decomposed the schemas to make it a lossless join and functional dependency preserving.
    </li>
    <li>Implemented SQL queries to copy the data from the original schema to decomposed versions. Implemented various SQL queries that involved joining multiple schemas.
    </li>
    <li>Running a script to determine the time taken to run each queries 1000 times.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4><strong>Motif Recognition on IVC Artifacts using CNN</strong></h4>
  <ul>
    <li>The main objective was to apply CNN on given IVC seal and the model should identify the pictorial part of the seal.
    <li>Generated an input dataset of 5000 images by augmenting 26 unique images.Used the ImagedataGenerator Class of Keras in Python for data augmentation.
    </li>
    <li>Applied CNN which comprised of one or more convolutional layers followed by one or fully connected layers.Conducted four different experiments on different number of convolutionallayers, dense layers and flatten layers and concluded that
      increasing the convolutional layers helped us to extract high level features of ours motifs and help us to achieve high accuracy.</li>
    </li>
    <li>In the final experiment we created our own custom model which achieved efficient feature extraction and prediction accuracy of around 40% which was earlier only 10% and successfully predicting 4 labels out of 5.</li>
  </ul>
